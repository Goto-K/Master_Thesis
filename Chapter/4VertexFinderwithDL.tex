\chapter{深層学習を用いた崩壊点検出} \label{chap:VertexFinderwithDL}

本章では、\ref{chap:Networks}章で作成したネットワークを使用した崩壊点検出について紹介する。
\ref{VFDL:AlgorithmforVFDL}節で具体的なアルゴリズムについて概説し、\ref{VFDL:AlgoVFDL:ReconstructionofPrimaryVertex}項でPrimary Vertexの再構成について、\ref{VFDL:AlgoVFDL:ReconstructionofSecondaryVertex}項でSecondary Vertexの再構成についての評価と調整をそれぞれ述べる。
最終的な性能や評価方法については\ref{VFDL:PerformanceofVFDL}節でまとめる。
