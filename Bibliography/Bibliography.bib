abstract = { Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms. }

abstract = "The next big project proposed in particle physics is the International Linear Collider (ILC), an electron positron collider with an energy reach of around 1TeV. The ongoing optimization and development of a detector for the ILC is only possible through the extensive use of sophisticated simulation software. In this paper we give a brief review of the software tools that are available in the currently ongoing three international detector concept studies and present two new software packages that have been developed in the context of the Large Detector Concept (LDC) study. The first is a C++ application framework that provides a platform for the distributed development of reconstruction and analysis software and the second is a conditions data toolkit. The interoperability with other software packages is discussed."

	abstract = {The detector description is an essential component that is used to analyze data resulting from particle collisions in high energy physics experiments. We will present a generic detector description toolkit and describe the guiding requirements and the architectural design for such a toolkit, as well as the main implementation choices. The design is strongly driven by easy of use; developers of detector descriptions and applications using them should provide minimal information and minimal specific code to achieve the desired result. The toolkit will be built reusing already existing components from the ROOT geometry package and provides missing functional elements and interfaces to offer a complete and coherent detector description solution. A natural integration to Geant4, the detector simulation program used in high energy physics, is provided.}

	journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
	abstract = {The detector description is an essential component that has to be used to analyse and simulate data resulting from particle collisions in high energy physics experiments. Based on the DD4hep detector description toolkit a flexible and data driven simulation framework was designed using the Geant4 tool-kit. We present this framework and describe the guiding requirements and the architectural design, which was strongly driven by ease of use. The goal was, given an existing detector description, to simulate the detector response to particle collisions in high energy physics experiments with minimal effort, but not impose restrictions to support enhanced or improved behaviour.

Starting from the ROOT based geometry implementation used by DD4hep an automatic conversion mechanism to Geant4 was developed. The physics response and the mechanism to input particle data from generators was highly formalized and can be instantiated on demand using known factory patterns. A palette of components to model the detector response is provided by default, but improved or more sophisticated components may easily be added using the factory pattern. Only the final configuration of the instantiated components has to be provided by end-users using either C++ or python scripting or an XML based description.}

abstract = "Cross sections for e+e− → n-jets, as functions of the jet resolution parameter ycut, are computed according to a new clustering algorithm. The jet multiplicity n is defined in such a way that jets i and j with energies Ei and Ej at relative angle angle θij are resolved if yij = 2(1−cosθij) min (Ei2, Ej2)s>ycut, where s is the centre-of-mass energy squared. Using this algorithm, large higher-order corrections at small values of ycut can easily be evaluated. Our calculations include resummation of leading and next-to-leading logarithms of ycut to all orders in QCD perturbation theory. This enables us to predict the jet cross sections at small ycut for arbitrary n. Simple analytical results for n\UTF{2A7D}5 are presented."
